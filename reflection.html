        <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
        <p>Responsive design has revolutionised how we fit and see websites on different technologies and screens. Traditionally the designer-built websites to accommodate one type of screen size. The type of screen and technology was usually the one the designer was building the website on. The problem was when users were using a different sized screen, the website would overflow into different borders and there was a lot of unused white space on the page. Historically only two website layouts were available to these designers. A liquid site which would stretch to fill a Browser window and fixed width site which was cleaner but left a lot of white space. Things got worse when mobile devices became more popular. Now the designers had to maintain two versions of their websites. One for the browser and one for mobile devices. Mobile users were getting more and more frustrated because many of the features of the browser website were not included in the mobile version. Just before the responsive design came to the rescue. In 2004 the flexible layout came into light, but it was not perfect. Then in 2010 Ethan Marcotte coined the term responsive design. Responsive Web design allows applications to adapt based on the technology or screen being used by the user. This includes adapting between computers, mobile, tablets and TV screens. This design ensures users have the same experience no matter which device they plan on using. This allows designers to create once and publish the same content everywhere. </p>
        <p>The responsive design uses a combination of three techniques:</p>
        <p>1. Flexible Layouts: responsive websites are built on flexible grids. These grids have a breaking point when the design layout changes. This is where the design will dynamically change when the content starts to change shape.</p>
        <p>2. Media grid: By keeping videos and images at max-width of 100%. This allows images to get small to fit the screen but never bigger and cause overflow and become pixelated.</p>
        <p>3. Media Queries: Without this technique the layout of the website can dynamically be changed depending on which scree it is being used on. This is by doing custom CSS to meets user needs.</p>
        <p>Learning about how hard it was to create one website to meet all screen sizes is unbelievable. Growing up with the responsive web technologies already in motion, It a relief how easy web development has become. Just reading up on how hard it was to be able to navigate a website on a phone seems hard to believe because now every website is compatible on all screens and technologies.

            This course has given me a strong foundation on how to create the content of a website by using HTML and then adding structure to the layout of the website by using CSS and then finally making the websites responsive and interactive by adding JavaScript. Before this I was using Bootstrap and didn’t really know what the CSS and JavaScript documents really meant. After learning how to create websites from scratch. It’s not easy and very challenging. My favorite part of this course was learning how to create an online store front and validating forms. This course has increased my interest and passion when it comes to web development.
